## ðŸŒ± About Me

I am a skilled data scientist, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) engineer with expertise in a wide range of topics. My areas of focus include modelization (churn, fraud, upsell, and propensity models), experimentation (A/B testing and causal inference using geo-lift techniques), causal machine learning for propensity modeling, and AI engineering (various AI applications for discussion systems and search engines).

**Key Skills:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Causal Inference, Experimentation, Modelization, AI Engineering

## ðŸ”­ Featured Projects

### 1. Churn Prediction Model

- **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company, leveraging customer data and usage patterns.
- **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
- **Approach:** Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. Implemented an XGBoost classifier and achieved an AUC score of 0.85.

### 2. Fraud Detection System

- **Description:** Built a fraud detection system for a financial institution using anomaly detection techniques and deep learning models.
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy
- **Approach:** Implemented an autoencoder for unsupervised anomaly detection and a deep neural network for supervised fraud classification. Achieved an F1-score of 0.92.

### 3. Causal Inference for Marketing Campaigns

- **Description:** Conducted causal inference analysis to measure the impact of marketing campaigns on customer engagement and sales using geo-lift techniques.
- **Technologies:** Python, CausalML, Econml, Pandas, NumPy
- **Approach:** Utilized causal inference methods, including double machine learning and synthetic control methods, to estimate the causal effect of marketing interventions.
